# We Are Now Open For **Submissions**

[Weâ€™re building a new kind of template marketplace](/){:target="_blank"} that works better for designers.

It's been a long time coming, but submissions are now open! We've got hundreds of talented designers who are interested in submitting, and hundreds of potential buyers who are excited by what we hope to accomplish.

#### The deadline for the first round of submissions is 11:59 PM UTC on Monday, December 16th.

## Now It's Your Turn!

All that remains is to receive your submissions, put the ones that make the cut up for sale to our audience of interested buyers, and promote the heck out of your excellent work to the whole world.

Before submitting, please peruse our [Guidelines For Great Templates](/guidelines.html){:target="_blank"} so that you understand the level of design and code quality we're looking for.

If you don't make the cut, we'll explain why, provide feedback on ways to improve, and welcome your re-submission.

## Payment Terms And Pricing

Designers will receive **70% of sales** with **no exclusivity agreements**.

We are setting the initial price floor at **$250 per template** and a cap of **$1000 per template.** You'll be able to specify the price of your template within that range, but please be aware that the price you set will be an important component in our review process. It's extremely important to us that every template we sell provides **greater value** than its cost.

## How To Submit

We'll be taking submissions via Dropbox.

If you don't already have one, you can get a free 2GB Dropbox account [here.]("https://www.dropbox.com/"){:target="_blank"}

If you're interested, please enter your name, contact email, and Dropbox account email below so that we can invite you to your personal submission folder.
