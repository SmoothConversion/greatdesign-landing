# Guidelines For **Great** Templates

[We’re building a new kind of template marketplace](/){:target="_blank"} that places the focus on quality and avoids the race-to-the-bottom economics that are prevalent on so many other template sites.

While our customers may be interested in the quick turnaround and lower cost that a template can provide, they still appreciate the value of a focused and sophisticated design, which is why they’ll pay more for a template that meets those standards.

In order to give this discerning bunch what they want, we’ll carefully evaluate submissions to ensure they meet our requirements for design quality and clean, well organized code. We’ve created these guidelines to give designers insight into what we’re looking for.

## Design Guidelines And Resources

A good way to get a sense of the aesthetic and level of design that we’re going for is to check out [Land Book](http://land-book.com/){:target="_blank"}, a curated collection of great landing pages. Most of these share certain characteristics:

- An **elegant**, **stylish**, and **friendly** vibe.

- **Simple**, **clean**, and focused on **content**.

- Not derivative or clichéed. Has a **unique personality.**

- **Responsive.** Designed to adapt smoothly to all common screen sizes.

- Good **visual hierarchy**. Attention isn’t pulled in many directions at once, but flows smoothly through the page.

- Clear and enticing **calls to action.**

- No excess bells and whistles, gimmicks, or unnecessary animation. Any flare or embellishment is added with care and **doesn’t distract from the content.**

- High quality **photography.**

- Clean, attractive, and content-appropriate **typography.**

- A high level of polish and **attention to detail.**

The same general principles apply to web application pages that contain the functional parts of a website. Supplying styled lists, grid, buttons, text, forms, and other components can be  valuable, but throwing together as many jQuery plugins as possible into an 'admin template' doesn’t cut it--that makes for a clunky and generic experience.

Application functionality deserves as much design love as the landing page, so with that in mind, here are a few more guidelines for applications:

- Application pages should be **uncluttered** and have a **clear focus** on important user actions.

- Application components should be **simple**, **usable**, and have **personality**, not a generic, stock, or 'admin portal' feeling.

- **Select open source components carefully.** Only include those that are high quality, responsive, and can integrate smoothly with the overall design and user experience.

We believe that talented designers who follow these guidelines and inject their own creativity will be able to produce work far better than what has become the norm for template sites. And on our marketplace, [they'll also receive far better rewards](/designers.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Code Guidelines And Resources

When we look at code, we'll judge it according to a few general factors:

- **Is it bug-free and working as it should across all major browsers and devices?** See  [Browser And Device Support](#browser-and-device-support) at the bottom of this page for the full list of browsers and devices we'll test on. We recommend [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/) or a similar tool for testing.

- **Is the code organized, readable, modular, maintainable, and extendable?** This includes organization of directories, files, and components, keeping files **short**, clean separation of html, css, and javascript, **naming things well**, consistent indentation, and following best practices for each language.

- **Does it rely on solid libraries and components?** When open source libraries and components are used, we will be checking on them to ensure they are architecturally sound, well-documented, and have developer-friendly APIs.

Rather than dig any further into the details of a topic that could fill several books (or several libraries), we'll point you toward a few style guides that we think offer good advice on keeping front-end code well structured. We aren't requiring that submissions follow *every* rule in these guides. We understand that people have their own styles. We don't need uniformity, but we *do* need fanatical devotion to organization, readability, and quality.

- [Codeguide.co](http://codeguide.co/){:target="_blank"} - a good all around front-end guide.

- [Github's CSS Style Guide](https://github.com/styleguide/css){:target="_blank"} - well-written and fairly brief guide to good css.

- [JQuery JavaScript Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/){:target="_blank"} and [JQuery HTML Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/html/){:target="_blank"} - a JQuery-oriented perspective.

- [CoffeeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide){:target="_blank"} - a good collection of best practices if you use CoffeeScript in your template.

- [ZURB Responsive Design Best Practices](http://zurb.com/responsive/design){:target="_blank"} - a guide from the creators of the responsive Foundation framework.

- [A List Apart Responsive Design Overview](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design){:target="_blank"} - a very well-written overview of the key considerations for designing and building responsive sites.

## Browser And Device Support

To illustrate our browser support requirements, we're borrowing this nifty table from [Bootstrap's browser support section](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support).

![Browser Support Requirements Table](/images/browser-support.png)

This means that templates must support the latest stable version of each listed browser on each platform where the two intersect with a checkmark. **For Internet Explorer, we require support of IE10+.**

**We do not require support of IE9, IE8, IE7, or IE6**, but you will have to specify whether your template supports these browsers, so you may want to consider doing so if gaining a somewhat wider market is worth the extra the effort.

We do not require support for any additional browsers or devices.

## Template Types And Platforms

As a general rule we are willing to consider any kind of theme or template as long as it meets our quality standards.
