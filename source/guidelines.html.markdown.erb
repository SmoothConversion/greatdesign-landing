# Template Guidelines

[We’re building a new kind of template marketplace](/){:target="_blank"} that places the focus on quality and avoids the race-to-the-bottom economics that are prevalent on so many other template sites.

While our customers may be interested in the quick turnaround and lower cost that a template can provide, they still appreciate the value of a focused and sophisticated design, which is why they’ll pay more for a template that meets those standards.

In order to give this discerning bunch what they want, we’ll carefully evaluate submissions to ensure they meet our requirements for design quality and clean, well organized code. We’ve created these guidelines to give designers insight into what we’re looking for.

## Design Guidelines

A good way to get a sense of the aesthetic and level of design that we’re going for is to check out [Land Book](http://land-book.com/){:target="_blank"}, a curated collection of great landing pages. Most of them share certain characteristics:

- An **elegant**, **stylish**, and **friendly** vibe.

- **Simple**, **clean**, and focused on **content**.

- Not derivative or clichéed. Has a **unique personality.**

- **Responsive.** Designed to adapt smoothly to all commonly used browsers, devices, and screen sizes.

- Good **visual hierarchy**. Attention isn’t pulled in many directions at once, but flows smoothly through the page.

- Clear and enticing **calls to action.**

- No excess bells and whistles, gimmicks, or unnecessary animation. Any flare or embellishment is added with care and **doesn’t distract from the content.**

- High quality **photography.**

- Clean, attractive, and content-appropriate **typography.**

- A high level of polish and **attention to detail.**

The same general principles apply to web application pages that contain the functional parts of a website. Supplying styled lists, grid, buttons, text, forms, and other components can be  valuable, but throwing together as many jQuery plugins as possible into an 'admin template' doesn’t cut it--that makes for a clunky and generic experience.

Application functionality deserves as much design love as the landing page, so with that in mind, here are a few more guidelines for applications:

- Application pages should be **uncluttered** and have a **clear focus** on important user actions.

- Application components should be **simple**, **usable**, and have **personality**, not a generic, stock, or 'admin portal' feeling.

- **Select open source components carefully.** Only include those that are high quality, bug-free, responsive, and can integrate smoothly with the overall design and user experience.

We believe that talented designers who follow these guidelines and inject their own creativity will be able to produce work far better than what has become the norm for template sites. And on our marketplace, they'll also receive correspondingly far better rewards.

## Code Guidelines

>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
> <cite>Martin Fowler</cite>

When we look at code, we'll judge it based two main factors.

1. Is it bug-free and working as it should across all common browsers and devices? See our [Platform Support Guidelines]("#platform-support-guidelines") at the bottom of this document.

2. This includes both organization of directories, files, and components at a high level, and
